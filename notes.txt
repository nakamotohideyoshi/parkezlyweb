- On Permits -

The general flow is, a user requests a permit, the permit gets approved, 
the user pays for the permit, after 1 year, the user has to pay again to renew the permit.

- Approve permit in permit_subscriptions 
- Find permit in parking_permits table
- Check if type "subscription"
- Check year field
- Every time you open the permits page check if any of the permits need to be renewed?
- If yes and unpaid make inactive
- On permit payment page (pay_for_permit), add a year for every subscription renewal paid.
