Complete (Needs minor bug fixes / quality of life changes):
    Township Panel Pages
    Inspector Panel Pages
    Subscriptions
    SMS / Text Servside API set up
    Email Serverside API set up
    Bursar Panel - 
        Tickets disabled when not paid.

Todo / Working on: 

    Multiple notifications merged into one email.
    Bursar Panel -
        Direct Transaction / Paypal API (May need more specific specs, may have a few questions for you or Devan later)

Currently Need:

- Email address and password from SMTP server to send notifications from ie: admin@soandso.com (gmail) 
and OAuth2 google api token or Amazon SES server, currently using my gmail for testing.
Might need an SMTP server / Amazon SES for live since google limits to 500 emails sent out per account a day.
- Twilio number to send from (under twillio dashboard number "phone numbers").
- Email addresses and numbers to send to (Eventually it will be organized and sent based on the admin accounts in the database. 
But may need at least one real email / number to send to instead of dummy data. Currently using mine to test for now.)
